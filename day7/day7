LeetCode 206: Reverse Linked List
📌 Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the reversed list.

🧠 Approach (Iterative)

We reverse the linked list by changing the direction of pointers one by one.

Steps:

Initialize three pointers:

prev → initially NULL

curr → starting from head

nextNode → to store the next node

Iterate through the list:

Store curr->next in nextNode

Reverse the link (curr->next = prev)

Move prev and curr one step forward

When traversal ends, prev becomes the new head.

⏱ Time & Space Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

💻 C++ Code
  class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        if(head==NULL || head->next==NULL){
            return head;
        }
        ListNode* temp=head->next;
        ListNode* prev=NULL;
        while(head!=NULL){
            head->next=prev;

            prev=head;
            head=temp;
            if(temp!=NULL){
                temp=temp->next;
            }
        }   
        return prev;

    }
};
